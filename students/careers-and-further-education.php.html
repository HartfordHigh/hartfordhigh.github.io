				<div>

					<p>To promote the career learning, development and wellbeing of students, we teach careers education &lsquo;as a subject&rsquo; but also &lsquo;through other subjects&rsquo;. As part of the teaching of their subjects, all teachers aim to link curriculum learning with careers.</p>

				<h2><a href="careers-and-further-education.php.html#" title="View full details">Start Programme</a></h2>
				
				<div>

					<p>As part of our commitment to prepare students for a rapidly changing world, we are delighted to announce that we are using an innovative online resource called Start during tutor time. Start will help your child to connect with their future career potential, develop their employability and help them to explore future career and study options at school or at home. It will also allow them to see what the labour market information is like in their chosen career and how that will change in the future. We will be asking Year 7 students to create their own account for Start at school in the next few weeks, but it is accessible anytime on computers and compatible mobile and tablet devices. Your child will personalise their profile on Start with details about their skills, qualities, interests and work preferences. This provides a starting point for them to explore information matched to their personal preferences and interests. As they update their profile, Start will personalise this information, helping them to navigate the thousands of jobs, courses, providers and opportunities available. Start will help students to understand where they are on their journey and what&rsquo;s important as they make their choices at GCSE, post-16 and post-18. </p>
					
					<p>Years 8-9 will continue their Start journey, fine-tuning their searches from last year. We encourage you to use Start with your child at home. Encourage them to rate jobs, qualifications, colleges or universities so that we can see their preferences in order to support them better. Parents can also use Start to find out more about jobs, training and study opportunities for themselves. Please do not log in using your child's user details and instead register yourself using the steps outlined below, creating your own username and password. For more information on Start or the support available for your son or daughter, please contact Ms Sutcliffe.</p>

				<h2><a href="careers-and-further-education.php.html#" title="View full details">Labour Market Information for students, carers and staff</a></h2>
				
				<div>

					<p>When someone receives good labour market information (LMI) that leads to a good decision, it benefits the individual, the employer and the economy.</p>

					<p>LMI can help people identify the skills they might require in the future. Even within familiar occupations, job tasks and job titles change and develop as products and technology change and develop.</p>

					<p>People need to be aware of how easy or hard it will be to get into their chosen career. They also benefit from accurate LMI about pay levels, job security and local prospects which they need to consider if they are to make realistic and informed career decisions. LMI can help people broaden their aspirations to include similar occupational areas in the event that their first choice not possible or not available in their area.</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s important for people to recognise the discrepancy between unrealistic aspirations and the likely outcomes. LMI can be used to set out the realities of the job market and allow people to avoid wasting time in areas where they are unlikely to be successful.</p>

				<h2><a href="careers-and-further-education.php.html#" title="View full details">Apprenticeships</a></h2>
				
				<div>

					<p>In Year 10, we start to introduce the ideas of apprenticeships, which continues into Year 11. Here is an overview of what an apprenticeship involves:</p>
					
					<p>Apprenticeships combine practical training in a job with study.</p>

					<p>As an apprentice you will:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Work alongside experienced staff</li>
						<li>Gain job-specific skills</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Apprenticeships take 1 to 5 years to complete depending on their level.</p>
					
					<h3>Levels of apprenticeship</h3>

					<p>Apprenticeships have equivalent educational levels.</p>
					
					<table class="center">
						
						<tr>
							<td class="header">Name</td>
							<td class="header">Level</td>
							<td class="header">Equivalent educational level</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>Intermediate</td>
							<td>2</td>
							<td>GCSE</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>Advanced</td>
							<td>3</td>
							<td>A level</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>Higher</td>
							<td>4,5,6 and 7</td>
							<td>Foundation degree and above</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>Degree</td>
							<td>6 and 7</td>
							<td>Bachelor&rsquo;s or master&rsquo;s degree</td>
						</tr>
						
					</table>
					
					<p>Some apprenticeships may also give you an additional qualification, such as a diploma.</p>
					
					<h3>Who can apply</h3>

					<p>You can apply for an apprenticeship while you are still at school. To start one, you will need to be:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>16 or over by the end of the summer holidays</li>
						<li>Living in England</li>
						<li>Not in full-time education</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>How to apply</h3>
					
					<p>There are 3 steps to applying for an apprenticeship.</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Search for an apprenticeship via companies directly</li>
						<li>Contact a local apprenticeship provider such as Total People</li>
					</ul>

				<h2><a href="careers-and-further-education.php.html#" title="View full details">Careers advice </a></h2>
				
				<div>

					<p>We believe that every student should have opportunities for guidance interviews with a Careers Advisor, which should be available whenever significant study or career choices are being made. Providing structured personal guidance time within the school enables students to focus on their future dreams and to set goals to achieve them. Access to independent and impartial professional career guidance is strongly valued by students and parents and is a recurring feature of good provision.</p>
					
					<p>Our Careers Advisor is available on Fridays, and students are able to make appointments through their Form Tutor, Head of Year or Careers Coordinator. Unbiased, impartial advice may be given on anything they wish to discuss about their future career progression, from apprenticeships to gap years. Our Careers Advisor is provided to us by an external provider - MPloy Solutions.</p>

				<h2><a href="careers-and-further-education.php.html#" title="View full details">Links with Employers</a></h2>
				
				<div>

					<p>At Hartford Church of England High School we pride ourselves on having excellent relationships with a wide host of businesses and Universities, who support us in so many ways: through mock interviews, careers fairs and carousels, workshops, assemblies and as guest speakers. We welcome any opportunity to work with our local and national businesses and institutions.</p>
					
					<p>The introduction of the Gatsby Benchmarks allows us to use these links with employers to work together in creative ways to ensure students are aware of the opportunities around them and are work-ready. We are now able to provide each year group from 7-11 one or more meaningful encounters with an employer, so &lsquo;a student has an opportunity to learn about what work is like or what it takes to be successful in the workplace.&rsquo;</p>
					
					<p>If you would like to participate and support us in any activity, please email me at msutcliffe@hartfordhigh.co.uk. Our provider access policy can be found in the careers section of the website, under the &lsquo;about us&rsquo; tab or by clicking here. We embrace the opportunity to form links with new employers. Below are the logos of some of the organisations with which we have links.</p>
